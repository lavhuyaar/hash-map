# Hash-map

I genuinely learned a lot while writing this code, of course this isn't something I wrote entirely on my own; I relied on YouTube and ChatGPT (a lot), but I understood how hash maps exactly work.

Added comments using ChatGPT as well; got to know how good comments actually look. I won't do it again; instead, I'll improvise my ability to write good comments.

The hashmap I created has O(n) Big-O notation. Using arrays instead of linked lists resulted in O(n^2) notation, so I improved it. I forgot to commit the hashmap I created before this one :(

Happy that I'm this far with DSA, I still have a long way to go.
